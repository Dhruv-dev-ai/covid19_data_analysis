# COVID-19 Comparative Public Health Analysis

## Objective
This project explores how COVID-19 impacted different countries by comparing infection rates, death rates, and vaccination coverage using R. Focus countries: India, USA, Brazil, and Germany.

## Highlights
- 📈 Time-series trends of new cases and deaths per million.
- ⚖️ Case Fatality Rate comparison across countries.
- 💉 Visual correlation between vaccination coverage and death reduction.

## Tools Used
- R (ggplot2, dplyr, lubridate)
- Data Source: Our World in Data (OWID)

## Key Insights
- The USA and Brazil had higher early peaks, while India's peak lagged.
- Germany showed lower CFR despite high case counts — reflecting strong healthcare.
- Vaccination rates inversely correlated with death rates across countries.

## To Run
Run `covid_analysis.R` after placing the dataset in `data/`.
